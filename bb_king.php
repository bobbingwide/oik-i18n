 * Syntax: oikwp bb_king.php

 *
 * Process
 * - Update WordPress to the latest level
 * - Update the translations for the English language version
 * - Run bb_king.php
 *
 * Note: bb_BB.php needs to work off .po files as well as .pot files, which means
 * - bb_BB has to handle msgstr values which have already been set.
 * - bb_BB has to know which files are la_CY.po files (with locale) and which are .pot ( without )
 * - bb_BB has to change directory to WP_LANG_DIR to locate these files
